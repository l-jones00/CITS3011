Where you can improve (optional tweaks)

You can keep your base rule and add any of these small, incremental upgrades later:
1. Weight stronger threats more
- Instead of 1, 2, 3 for 1/2/3 in a row, use something like 1, 4, 16 (or square the count).
- This makes “three-in-a-row with a gap” much more valuable than scattered singles.

2. 3-with-1-empty bonus
- If a window has exactly 3 of yours and 1 empty, add a bigger bonus (e.g., +25).
- Do the symmetric penalty for the opponent. This makes the AI very eager to create or block immediate threats.

3. Center-column bias
- Add a tiny bonus for having pieces in column 3 (the middle).
- The center participates in more windows and is strong strategically.

4. Immediate win/loss priority
- You already do this via terminal checks. Keep those scores much bigger than heuristic numbers.
